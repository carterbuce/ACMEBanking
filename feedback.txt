Feedback on the 4003-243 Project 2: 

Course: 	CSCI 140-03

My name is: 	Carter Buce

What did you learn by doing this assignment?

	I learned a lot about creating a program with MVC and I learned a lot about
	using swing, particularly that it is very difficult to use without some sort
	of window building tools, but it is much easier to understand now that I know
	how to make frames and windows by hand.


What was easy about this assignment?

	the Bank class was easiest because I have a lot of experience by now with dealing
	with command line arguments and reading and writing from files. It was especially easy
	since there is no need to check for incorrect file input, since it was only written
	and read using my program


What was harder than you originally thought?

	I found it was difficult to connect the classes using MVC since it was my first time
	using the pattern, and I kept getting the controller to be able to either read or write 
	to the view, but I couldn't figure out how to do both until I passed an actionlisterner 
	to the constructor of the gui 


What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	I think the assignment was as good as it could be


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	I would have liked to know more about MVC, especially observer/observable and when to
	and not to use it.


What other issues would you like to discuss?

	none
